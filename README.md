# Fortran Week Two Solution

This repository contains the code solution for the second week of Fortran lessons in [AOS 573](http://aos573.github.io). See the assignment [here](https://aos573.github.io/assignments/3-fortran-arrays-io.html).

Note a compilation script is added strictly for ease--it was not required.
