There is always at least a 4% difference in relative humidity (RH) between wind coming from the west and wind coming from the east (with the latter always higher). In the case of the yearly average, that difference is much larger--mainly due to a lower RH from the west while RH from the east is nearly the same. There is not much of a change when using winds greater than 2 miles per hour (mph); a larger threshold of say 5 or 10 mph may provide more stark contrast. Finally, the first quarter provides a much larger contrast between winds from the east and west than those during the third quarter.
